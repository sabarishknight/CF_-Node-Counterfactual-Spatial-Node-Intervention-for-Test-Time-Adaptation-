## Overview

CF-NODE is a training-free Test-Time Adaptation framework that improves the robustness of diabetic retinopathy grading models under domain shift by identifying important lesion representations, generating counterfactual feature interventions, and refining predictions using ordinal reasoning and source prior correction.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CF-NODE.git

cd CF-NODE

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Train the Reference Model

The repository includes the DeepSet reference model used in our experiments.

```bash
python model/train.py
```

---

## Apply CF-NODE

CF-NODE expects the model to return

```python
(
    logits,
    node_features,
    ordinal_logits
)
```

Once the model follows this interface, CF-NODE can be integrated directly into the inference pipeline.

```python
from cfnode.cfnode import run_tta

predictions = run_tta(
    model,
    loader,
    cfg
)
```

---

## Reference Model

The `model/` directory contains the complete DeepSet reference implementation used in our experiments, including

- model architecture
- training configuration
- training script

The reference model can be used directly or adapted for other datasets.
